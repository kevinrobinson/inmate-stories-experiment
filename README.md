# rehumanizing-datasets-experiment
experimenting with re-humanizing a dataset

this experiment is more like an art project, with simple toy heuristics for "rendering."  this is just hacking what it might look like, and not all pieces are even connected to the dataset.

but could we learn an encoder-decoder pair, to re-humanize anonymized data sets?

  real life > compressed > real life

this isn't about making accurate inferences, it's about changing the nature of how people can interact with the data.  what would it look like to do this with interviews, or from ethnographic data sets, or even just survey datasets?  lots of caveats about generalization, but maybe could create interesting art pieces in places with lots of interviews or ethnography (eg, for this kaggle dataset, it might be a single ethnographic study on some particular angle).
